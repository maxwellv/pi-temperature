Okay, so this is just a tiny utility (and by "tiny" I mean that I referenced all the docs and banged it out over about an hour, while watching a Nashville Predators game on TV) that I wrote for pretty-printing my Raspberry Pi's temperature.

Usage
-----
* have node installed on your Pi
* clone this repo (or just the temperature.js file)
* at the command line: ./temperature.js
